  "text": "There are plenty of great deals to be found, but a few standouts include The Lord of the Rings 4K trilogy for $41.99 ($25.81 off), which is nearly matching its Black Friday low. Along with all three movies in the series, it also includes the extended versions. Another highlight is HBO’s Chernobyl on 4K Blu-ray, with the complete series available for just $14.99, down from $39.99."
