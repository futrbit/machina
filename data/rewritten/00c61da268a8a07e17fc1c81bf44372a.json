  "text": "Rewritten: Let’s face it: Dyson is better known for vacuum innovation than for selling budget-friendly products. Thankfully, the Dyson 360 Vis Nav — the company’s first robot vacuum in more than a decade — is now available from Amazon , Best Buy , Target , and Dyson for around $799.95 ($200 off), which is easily the best price we’ve seen.\n\nFor some people, the 360 Vis Nav’s short battery life, missing AI-powered obstacle avoidance, and lack of an auto-empty dock are real deal breakers — something our own resident smart home reviewer, Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, was quick to point out in her hands-on of the D-shaped vac last year. However, Dyson’s latest robot vacuum isn’t as focused on high-end features as it is on mere power and precision.\n\nFor starters, the vacuum touts a whopping 65 air watts of suction, rendering it one of the most powerful models available and the best robot vacuum for carpets we’ve ever tested. It’s also outfitted with a massive roller brush that’s situated at the front, allowing it to reach the edges of your rooms and into corners, along with a large 500ml dustbin that can easily be removed using the integrated handle. You’re only going to get about 65 minutes of runtime, though, and because of its navigation shortcoming, it’s best suited for homes with relatively simple floor plans. Still, if you fall into that bucket, you’d be hard-pressed to find a more powerful model at this price."
