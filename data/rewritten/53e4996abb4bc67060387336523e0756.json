If you know what to look for and can spot a good deal, you can build a top setup yourself—or, even easier, just get a ready-to-use, super-powerful little computer like the GMKtec mini PC which is on sale for a big discount on Amazon right now.\n\nThe GMKtec mini PC featuring a turbo up to 5.0 GHz Intel Core i7-1195G7 processor, 32GB DDR4, and spacious 1TB NVMe SSD is now available for the affordable price of $409, which is a massive 36% discount from its original price of $639. This is not typical for this style of promotion and Black Friday or Prime Day apparently have come early.\n\nSee at Amazon\n\nSlim, Powerful and Efficient\n\nGMKtec has become one of the top mini PC brands with a reputation for making slim, powerful and efficient computers that are best-sellers at Amazon. Their designs are renowned for squeezing high-end hardware into tiny, energy-efficient packages that are perfectly suited to home, office or even commercial application. The model currently available for sale at Amazon is a classic example of this philosophy: it’s tiny enough to take almost anywhere, but its performance is as good as that of much larger and more expensive desktops.\n\nThis mini PC boasts an 11th generation Intel Core i7-1195G7 processor which a true powerful processor with four cores, eight threads and a turbo boost clock speed of a whopping 5.0 GHz. This processor is significantly faster than several of its counterparts, like the i7-10810U, i5-12450H, and i5-8259U and is ideal for resource-intensive tasks like video editing, light gaming and business software. Despite its impressive performance, the system sips power with a typical consumption of just 35W.\n\nThe GMKtec Mini PC comes loaded with 32GB of dual-channel DDR4 RAM which supports smooth multitasking but can also be expanded up to 64GB for future-proofing. Storage is equally impressive with a 1TB NVMe SSD (PCIe 3.0) that can be upgraded to a whopping 2TB plus an additional M.2 2242 SATA slot for even more expansion.\n\nGraphics performance is another strong suit thanks to the integrated Intel Iris Xe Graphics G7 96EU GPU. This chip delivers rapid HD video across everything from 4K video playback to casual gaming and it is able to power up to three independent 4K monitors simultaneously. The mini PC also features dual-band Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 for rapid wireless connectivity and a 2.5Gbps Ethernet port for lightning-fast wired networking.\n\nIt also included two HDMI outputs (4K @ 60Hz), a USB Type-C (4K @ 60Hz), and a few USB 3.2 ports. Peripherals, external storage, and numerous monitors can easily be connected all from a device that can be fitted within your palm. The quality of the construction is outstanding, and the system is designed for hassle-free operation so it is a great choice for home offices or classrooms.\n\nWith capabilities like these for so little money, there is no denying it: the days of pricey desktops are over and the age of smart, small form-factor computing has arrived at last.\n\nSee at Amazon"
