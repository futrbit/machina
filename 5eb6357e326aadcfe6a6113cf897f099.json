You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information in any forum, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other people. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances. Please take care when using these features.  You may request and obtain removal of such posted content by contacting us at <a href=\"mailto:compliance@recurrent.io\">compliance@recurrent.io</a> and specifically identifying the content to be removed.  Please be advised that any such removal does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of all traces of the content posted on the Recurrent forums.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong><u>Data Retention</u></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will retain your personal information only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information; the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information; the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means; and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances, you may ask us to delete your information. Additionally, we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong><u>Data Security</u></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We have implemented and maintained reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information, to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. However, no security measure is perfect, so we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply common protections described in this policy.</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong><u>Our Clients</u></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you are a client or business partner of ours, then the contract between your company and Recurrent shall prevail over this Privacy Policy to the extent of any conflict.</p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li><strong><u>International Data Transfers</u></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are located and operate in the United States. By submitting personal information to us, you understand that we may transfer your personal information to country foreign to you, including the United States, for processing. The laws that apply to the use and protection of personal information in the United States, or other countries or jurisdictions in which we transfer or process personal information, may be different from the laws and protections in your country. These transfers may include transfers to our service providers located in foreign jurisdictions. Whenever we engage a service provider, we require that its privacy and security standards adhere our requirements and applicable privacy laws.</p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li><strong><u>Your Privacy Preferences</u></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can control the collection and use of personal information for some of our processing activities.

We currently support Global Privacy Control (GPC), a specification designed to allow internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as whether or not they want to be tracked or have their personal information sold or shared with third parties for targeted advertising. It consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and acts as a mechanism that our Websites can use to honor your privacy settings. GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions, click here to view the options. If you want to use GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser extension. More information about downloading GPC can be found by clicking <a href=\"https://globalprivacycontrol.org/\">here</a>.

We may also provide other promotional campaigns, such as sweepstakes, contests, or limited-time promotions (collectively, the “Programs”). When you sign up for one of these Programs, we typically ask you to provide your name and contact information (such as email address and/or telephone number). Because our Programs involve the collection of personal information, they might be interpreted as a “financial incentive” program under the CCPA. The value of your personal information to us is related to the value of the free or discounted products or services, or other benefits that you obtain or that are provided as part of the applicable Program, less the expense related to offering those products, services, and benefits to Program participants. Participation in a Program is governed by the applicable terms and conditions (including the official rules for any sweepstakes or contest or the promotional terms for any short-term promotion), which will also describe the financial incentives associated with the promotion and how to participate. You are not obligated to participate in any contest, sweepstakes, or short-term promotion and may terminate your participation at any time (as described in the survey terms and conditions). You may withdraw from participating in a Program at any time by contacting us using the designated method set forth in the applicable Program terms and conditions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nevada</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although we do not “sell” “covered information” of Nevada “consumers” as those terms are defined under Chapter 603A of the Nevada Revised Statutes, you may contact us by sending an email to <a href=\"mailto:compliance@recurrent.io\">compliance@recurrent.io</a> and registering your email address so that we can provide you notice in the event we should do so in the future.
